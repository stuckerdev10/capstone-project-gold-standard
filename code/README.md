# Code

This is the folder for all the code we used in our project:
 - The ARIMA model files are the code for the machine learning portion of this project
 - Commodities producer and consumer files are the producer and consumer for the commodities api that was run every two minutes through our data factory 
 - SQL table scripts are how we set up our database in the SQL server
