# Dashboard

This folder contains two Power BI reports.

The gold-standard-visualizations report contains visualizations regarding the real-time data from the Commodities API and domestic data.

The forecasting-and-exports data contains international data and data from our machine learning model.

The reports were made separate to account for having both a constantly updating data source and for importing a machine learning model, a feature that cannout currently be done together in Power BI.

Here is an image of one page from gold-standard-visualizations report:
