With our capstone project, we hope to be able to answer some questions that we have concerning some of the most basic commodities of the United States like corn, wheat, and soybeans. We want to discover the changes in the value of these commodities, both in the present and over time, in relation to the US dollar and to gold. We also want to see if we can discover the causes of the changing prices of these commodities, and see if we can predict these prices in the future. Furthermore, we want to discover where the greatest producers and consumers of these products are, both domestically and internationally. We will be using a Commodities-API and the US Census to discover some of this data.
